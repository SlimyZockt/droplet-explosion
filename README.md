### ***Waring!***

Dont use in production!! Its a buggy mess.


### ***About the Project***

It's a project from contest "Jugend Forscht". 

#### Project dirscribstion
In our project "The Droplet Bursting" we are investigating a phenomenon known as Marangoni Bursting. 
When a drop of an alcohol-water mixture is dropped on oil, the original drop splits into many small droplets. 
We want to determine the parameters that affect the number of droplets, the radius and later the velocity from initial to final stage, as well as the distance between the droplets. 
This is to work with the help of a self-programmed image recognition software. This recognizes droplets to which food coloring has previously been added. The data obtained is then displayed graphically and evaluated by us. From this, we draw our conclusions about the parameters.
